MSDS Capstone project by Anahita Sharma, Burke Lawlor, and Jason Wang during the 2021-2022 academic year at the University of Virginia. Research presented at the 2022 IEEE SIEDS conference.

Project focuses on developing a Crohn's disease versus control classifier using H&E stained small intestine biopsies derived from pediatric patients across two hospital systems. Site-specific models were capable of identifying Crohn's disease with up to 93% accuracy, however, were limited in their generalizability across sites. Further investigation suggested stain normalization and white space differences served as site-specific artifacts between images from the two sites. Therefore, further work is needed to increase available data sets and investigating techniques to limit the impact of site-specific artifacts on disease classification imaging models.
